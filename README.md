# React-Typescript Dev Kit for FileMaker Developers

Based on the template by Jeremy Brown from Integration Magic.

*Develop, Render, and Deploy React App for a FileMaker App*

# This Kit
## What it does
This environment allows a FileMaker developer to start coding their widget in typescript using react and see the results right away in a FileMaker file. Once done developing, the can be inlined and pushed to the FileMaker file for use offline.
<br/>
It's a template file, so you can use to start other projects.
## Consists of
- A repository template on Github
- A basic html / JS set up.
- package.json file for install
- A FileMaker file to show the widget rendered
- Scripts to build and upload the inlined code to FileMaker
## TO GET STARTED Using this file
1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
3. Open the jsDev.fmp12 file.
4. Allow it to work in Dev mode.

At this point you should see the web viewer on the layout load up with the HTML and JavaScript here. Edit the index.ts or the index.html and you'll see the render in the web viewer update.

## Use this kit
Now you're ready to use this kit to create awesome TS widgets.

## Special Thanks
Josh Willing for detail instructions on how to set up the environment and reference for type of FileMaker.PerformScriptWithOption.
